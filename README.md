# 2D to 3D SBS Video Converter
***Optimized for Mac Silicon***

## *WORK IN PROGRESS; NOT YET READY FOR USE*

This is a script to take any 2D Video file you have and then process it into a 3D Side-By-Side video file, compatable with any player that supports 3D SBS Video Playback.
Works best when resulting file is viewed on VR Headsets otherwise It's very difficult to get the desired effect. 

## Requirements
- ffmpeg
- numpy
- mlx
- opencv-python
- tqdm
- Mac or other Apple Computer (It will still probably work on windows or linux but have not tested and will run on CPU)
